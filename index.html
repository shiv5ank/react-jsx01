                Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold
                shoes. Today, we still sell shoes - as well as clothing, handbags,
                accessoires, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer
                service, customer experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the
                world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver happiness to
                customers, employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in a
                long-term, sustainable way.
            </p>

            <p style={{
                textAlign:"center"
            }}>
                We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling
                shoes online. Instead, they'll know Zappos as a service company that
                just happens to sell ______.
